# Deque

A Deque (double-ended queue) is a a generic list in such a way that we can start either at the front, or at the back, and move through the list in either direction. It has two ends, a front and a rear, and the items/data remain positioned in the collection. New items can be added at either the front or the rear. Likewise, existing items can be removed from either end.
